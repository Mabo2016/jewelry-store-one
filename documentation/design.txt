Software design document. What Django models, templates, views, forms, model
forms, and such are to be created. Also, what each will contain and the tasks
it will be responsible for. Also, document other decisions like hacks, fixes,
configurations, and whatever else that does not normally fit in with the other
categories.

Plan:
    View Own Account
        1. Modify the model to have phone number, and physical address.
        2. Modify signup process to account for phone number,
        and the delivery address.
        3. Sign in and sign out stay the same.
        4. user_profile_view.py & user_profile_form.py.
        5. user_profile.html


Jewelry browsing and searching
    1. Filtered content
        Implement one page, jewelry-list, where all the jewelry are listed.
        Allow the user to filter them, by category (e.g earrings or bracelets).
        Or by something else, like date added, price, or some combination.
    2. Fractioned content
        Create several pages, one for each jewelry category, bracelets, rings,
        earrings, and so on. And then allow filtering on each page for date
        added, price, and such.

    Pros:
        Filtered
            * Fewer pages
            * Less coding
            * Less navigation
            * Allows combination of various jewelry
            * Caters to users who are looking for very specific items, and for
            those who aren't
            *
        Fractioned
            * Clearly separated content
            * Clearly communicates the content
            * Perhaps easier with tabbing in a browser
            * Allows category-specific code
    Cons:
        Filtered
            * May cause trouble with tabbing in browsers
            * May make the site seem simplistic
            * May make the site seem lacking in content
        Fractioned
            * Extra code and files
            * May be unnecessary
            * If there are many categories the navigation bar and menu will be
            cluttered with various pages to visit.
            * Harder to extend or add content in the form of new categories.

    Decision
        Make it filtered. Then later on maybe implement a fractioned version
        of the site.

    Design:
        Filter on category, date added, price, metal/texture
        Categories:
            Earrings, rings, bracelets, necklaces, brooches, tiaras
        Metal/texture:
            Rose gold, gold, platinum, silver

    Code:
        templates:
            jewelry_list.html
            jewelry_detail.html
        views:
            jewelry_view.py
        models:
            jewelry

        data:
            jewelry
                name:           char field
                date_added:     date_time
                price:          decimal
                metal_used:     char field, list
                thumbnail:      image
                detail_images:  list of images
        gui:
            jewelry_list.html
                * Paginated list of jewelry items filtered by the user.
                * A filters bar to filter jewelry based on date added, price,
                category, and metal used
                * A main content area where rows of 5 columns are shown, each
                cell having one jewelry shown.
                * Each cell shows a thumbnail of the item, with its name, and
                price.
                * Pagination by 50 items
                * View in detail possible by clicking on an item.
            jewelry_detail.html
                All the details of the item shown on screen, except the
                thumbnail.
                Images at the top.
        views:
            list_jewelry
                takes in filtering data and returns a list of items according
                to the filters and pagination.
            detail_jewelry
                Just show the details of the item, except the thumbnail.

    My Cart
        Need a my cart page for the user
        accessible when logged in only
        An add to cart button should appear or look active if and when the user
        is logged in browsing jewelry
        My cart page should allow removal of items, and the alteration of the
        quantity of the items in the cart, without addition of new types of
        items. The latter is done in the jewelry page.
        Show the total price for all items in the cart.
        Show the total quantity of items in the cart.
        Show the price of each type of item in the cart.
        Show the quantity added of each type of item in the cart.
        Show the price x quantity of each type of item in the cart
        Show that the delivery will take a week from the time the order was
        placed.

    Place Order
        Place order button appears on the my cart page
        Inactive if there are no items in the cart
        Active if there is 1 or more items in the cart
        If button pressed then ask for confirmation from the user
        Also, if pressed, inform the user of how long the delivery will take,
        and the total price

    Design solutions:
        A separate template for my cart "my_cart.html".
        The page should show a table with all the user's items.
            My Cart Table's Columns:
                Item Name   Individual price    Quantity Added  Total Price
                string      decimal             integer         decimal

            A button that allows to alter the quantity added per type of
            item should be placed near the table or in the table.
            If not practical then this feature should be disallowed and the
            user will have to alter the quantity from without the page.
            Also, if not possible then the user should be allowed to
            delete the entire row of the table.
