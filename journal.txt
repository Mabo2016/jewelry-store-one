        1. Jewelry browsing and searching. Did not finish.
        2. Needed to install pillow for imagefield for models but terminal
        failed. Apparently the internet connection was not good enough, as it
        kept timing out.
        3. The model jewelry is mostly done. Some of the design is done, but
        the rest is not done. The views, and templates.

        1. Installed the pillow library for imagefield functionality for
        models. Downloaded it with the browser, Safari, which worked far
        better than terminal for whatever reason.
        2. Did not test it, only installed it.
