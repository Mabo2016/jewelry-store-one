        1. Jewelry browsing and searching. Did not finish.
        2. Needed to install pillow for image field for models but terminal
        failed. Apparently the internet connection was not good enough, as it
        kept timing out.
        3. The model jewelry is mostly done. Some of the design is done, but
        the rest is not done. The views, and templates.
Saturday, 22-09-2018, unknown, but less than 2 hours of work.
    Unknown, < 2 hours of work
        1. Installed the pillow library for image field functionality for
        models. Downloaded it with the browser, Safari, which worked far
        better than terminal for whatever reason.
        2. Did not test it, only installed it.

        1. Added jewelry browsing, in list and detail.
        2. No filtering yet.
        3. Learned how to use Pillow's image field.
        4. Need to learn about user's uploading and serving of images for
        production environments.
    18:32 - 20:00
        1. Jewelry browsing. Results can be filtered but by typing text in,
        not by pressing buttons. More work needed.
        2. Used package called django_filters but still don't understand it.

    16:56 - 20:00 CONTINUED TOMORROW at 02:00 - 03:47
        1. Work on filtering results.
        2. Failed to implement a working one.
        3. Best result was with links that lead to the same template and view
        but the function view is given different params with urls dispatcher.
        However, the filtering, with django-filters, is ruined and the
        filters are forgotten since a "new page" is displayed.
        4. Will have to look into other django projects, and read more
        documentation especially about models and the meta ordering attribute.
