    1. Tried to implement user sign up with email validation.
        P: account_activation_sent. Django cannot find it, but the tutorial
        demanded that it be referenced in the app's urls.py.
        PS: Apparently, account_activation_sent is a custom view the tutorial
        implied that I had to code. The function view does nothing but return
        a render with request and a link to the email_activation_sent template.
        FE: The index page of the jewelryapp site does not load. Safari keeps,
        "loading it". Perhaps lacking internet connection is an issue or some
        other mistake was made.

    2. Sign up user with a profile and email validation
        P: Did not know how to update the user's profile details when created.
        S: Followed the solution from:
            "How to Create User Sign Up View by Vitor Freitas"
        Should use one form only. For both the user and profile. Also,
        the meta for the SignUpForm class should be User. The profile's
        attributes are updated after the user is created with save() in the
        signup view and after the user object is reloaded with
        "refresh_from_db". This is in order to obtain the profile object,
        which was newly created.
        The attributes of the profile class can be displayed in the form by
        listing them explicitly in the signup form.
